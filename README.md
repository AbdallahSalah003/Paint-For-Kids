# Paint-For-Kids
My First Project Ever Using C++ "Without stl" its a Project for Programming Tech. Course , 1st Year Computer Engineering student .
We've tried to write a C++ code for Paint for Kids application. A working project
is NOT enough for Us.We've used object-oriented programming to implement this application and try to
respect the responsibilities of each class.
